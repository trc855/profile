          <p>In essence, the purpose of this page is to display some the projects I have worked on.</p>
          <p>Some of these will be personal projects and some will be things I've worked on with my friends. Nothing here comes from a professional context.</p>
          <p>You can find these projects down below, the rest of this page is just me having fun ðŸ˜Š</p>

          <p>I have a relatively overwritten "about me" section on my CV and Linked In profile, but all you really need to know about me is this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I studied maths at uni because it was the most fun major</li>
            <li>I dabbled in compsci at uni but didn't really warm to the style in which it was taught (still got A's though ðŸ˜Ž)</li>
            <li>I then signed up for a web dev bootcamp and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>My main interest lies in backend development, can you tell?</li>
            <li>Parlez-vous franÃ§ais? Moi non plus</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <p>One bonus fun fact about me is that I am getting pretty good on the computer actually.</p>

          <p>Roots is a simple, cute garden tracker and management app my friends and I made as our final project. We were quite limited by time and expertise but I am proud of the team and the final result.</p>
          <p>I really enjoyed putting into practice what I had learned about databasing, schema design, migrations, and the MVC pattern. Using modals for all our forms presented new challenges, which required me to extend myself and build on what I had been taught. Although not my wheelhouse, I spent a lot of time on frontend in an effort become more well rounded. The "Add Crop Form", "Notification Worm", "Helpful Hints" and Info dropdowns are the frontend contributions I am most proud of.</p>
          <p>Big shout out to <a href="https://github.com/cnandes">Claire</a> for having a vision, taking the lead, and putting in a superhuman effort. Also big respect to <a href="https://github.com/archie3DXR">Archie</a> for the amazing 3D!</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.roots-app.garden/" target="_blank">Here</a> is the app. <a href="https://github.com/cnandes/roots" target="_blank">Here</a> is the repo.</p>

          <p>Spent (formerly Air-NAP) is an Air-BNB clone my group made during the bootcamp as a preamble to Roots. The idea is essentially the same but our mutual love of naps led us to make one small tweak.</p>
